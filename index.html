<p>​</p> 
<p> If you are not a fan of 90s hip hop rap, we still highly recommend watching the movie "Straight Outta Compton." </p>

<p>The film depicts the challenges faced by young black individuals just 30 years ago and is a powerful reminder of the important issues and events of that time. </p>
<p> To watch the film, <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" style="color: green;" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Straight-Outta-Compton-OShea-Jackson/dp/B015D2IDOO/ref=atv_pr_sw_sc"> click here</a>. </p>
